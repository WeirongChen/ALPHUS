# Open Ultrasound Probe Stabilizer (OpenUpS)
Open platform for 3D-printed ultrasound probe stabilizer.
#### The current design can fit both adult and young children.
#### The orientation can be transformed between mid-sagittal plane and coronal plane (90 degree perpendicular to sagittal plane) by switching from 'rod_hex' to 'rod_L-shape'.
- The ‘print_list.txt’ specifies how many pieces you need for each component. 
- In the ‘clips’ folder, only print the one pair (left and right halves) that matches your ultrasound probe.

#### The current design evolved from our previously published paper:
